# Try It!
# Use the following space to write a function that does the following:
# 1. Takes two inputs, 'banana_count' and 'tomato_count'.
# 2. Print out the total amount of bananas.
# 3. Print out the total amount of tomatoes.
# 4. Have the function return the total amount of items.
#
# Bonus: Write the proper documentation for the function. See how it's
# done with the function multiply(x, y)! To view quick documentation,
# press F1 [note that you may need to press the Fn key if your computer's
# function row are programmed to secondary functions (for a Mac, they are
# programmed to the functions as indicated by the icon)].


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace the following line with your function call.
    exit()
